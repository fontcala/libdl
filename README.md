Deep Learning Library 

## IMPORTANT NOTE
There are many TODOs, but I am going to make big changes soon, which makes solving these TODOs futile.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run
```
make
```
in the build folder.
This generates library, tests, and python bindings.
In order to compile the documentation run
```
make doc_doxygen
```
in the build folder. And check the results in the folder build/doc/html or build/doc/latex

### Prerequisites

C++17 compiler.

## Running the tests

TODO

## submodules
